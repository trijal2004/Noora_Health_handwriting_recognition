Keep the bathing essentials ready
Prepare the water with just the right temperature for the baby.
Keep the towel + dress + after bath essentials ready.
Warm the oil just a bit, as generally baby oils become very hot very quickly. Ensure that the oil is not too hot, just a little warm before applying to the baby.
While Bathing:
Place the baby gently on your legs, head towards your feet and in a upside-down position, so that the baby’s back is up and the face is placed gently between the legs.
Ensure that the baby’s head is placed such that it is able to breathe easily. Be careful with the neck, and ensure there are no jerks anywhere while handling the baby.
Take little oil and apply to the head and body. massage gently. Turn the baby and place on the legs in similar position and gently apply oil to the face, massaging well.
We would recommend two people to give bath to the baby. One person would hold the baby and other pour the water. Water should be not be too hot.
While pouring water, if two people are giving the bath, one of them can hold the baby straight, with palm shielding the top of the head such that the water does not fall directly on baby’s face.
If one person is giving bath, it is better to place the baby back again on the legs, upside down, such that the baby can breath easily and while pouring water, ensure one hand shields the baby’s face when water is poured. While washing the face, gently rub with powder / soap and wipe of gently. Ensure that the water/ powder / soap does not enter the nostrils or mouth. This can be dangerous to the baby.
Wipe the baby dry with the towel kept ready and dress it up. Any delay in this might cause cold in the baby.
